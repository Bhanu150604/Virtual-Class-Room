        Disadvantages:Higher sea levels lead to flooding of lowlands. Islands and coastlines are engulfed by water leading to death and disease due to flooding.
            Deserts become drier, leading to increased desertification, resulting in border conflicts in already water-scarce areas.
            Decreased agricultural production leads to food shortages.
            Starvation, malnutrition, and increased deaths result from food and crop shortages.</b></p>
